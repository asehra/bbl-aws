BBL AWS
=======

A set of tools to set up bosh on aws. This docker file was created to have an
isolated build environment for bosh-init used under the hood by bbl.

The main tools that it contains:
 - Bosh v2 CLI
 - bosh-bootloader (and its dependencies, eg ruby)
 - aws CLI

Usage
-----

You can use this repo by pulling the image:

```
docker pull asharmakuni/bbl-aws
```

And create a container:

```
docker run -it -v $PWD:/home/aws/bbl asharmakuni/bbl-aws
```

The command above also mounts the current directory at `/home/aws/bbl` inside
the container. You can use this folder to export the state file generated by bbl
during `bbl up`.

After starting the container, you'd need to run AWS configure to be able to use
the AWS CLI. Then `cd` into the the `bbl` folder and follow the guide for
[setting up bosh aws using bbl](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-bootloader/blob/master/docs/getting-started-aws.md).
